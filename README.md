# Neural_Flow_Tribute
- This contains notes on my stemming from excellent YouTube videos at https://www.YouTube.com/@NeuralFlowDev.
- This project is only documentation right now
	- related useful automation, recipes or tools are a possible future goal. 


## Motivation for this project
The neatest thing happening right now is using agents to perform AI tasks.
When it comes to coding agents, all the cool kids are talking about Claude Code (CC) from Anthropic.  But how about people who don't have access to CC, but do have access to Visual Studio Code and GitHub copilot? Are there other companies like Microsoft catching up to the CC craze?  Can I do any hands on experiments on that?

There are a couple videos demonstrating a Visual Studio Code + GitHub copilot approach which resemble a CC agent solving a problem while the human sits back and watches, or wanders off for a coffee:
1. https://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=klKXZsB7FSw around 7:45
2. https://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=F2XkbeazOEc&t=111s around 2:30

	+ faster than pulling up the video and nudging through it until you can answer the question
	- example 1
		+ what video, minute, and second does he install c-sharp janitor? *
		+ > The C# janitor chat mode is installed in the video titled "Get Awesome-Copilot custom chat modes and prompt files - right from within GitHub Copilot Chat.".
		+ > Specifically, at 00:04:26 in the video, the speaker states, "I'm going to say install the C.net janitor" which then initiates the download and placement of the file into the chat modes folder within the repository. The C# janitor was suggested by GitHub Copilot Chat after analyzing the repository content, which in this case was a C# application.
	- example 2
		+ what does he type in to get suggestions for chat prompts to install?
		+ > To get suggestions for chat prompts to install, the speaker types a specific command into the GitHub Copilot Chat window after having performed an initial setup.
